# Leetcode392
Leetcode392 Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some 
(can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 
(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

While this might be the stated runtime, considering that the Big O is n^2 it is still slow even if memory usage is good

Memory 7.77MB
Beats 99.99%

This kind of usage would mainly be useful for code that needs to be run a minimal times and with string that are average to smaller sizes
